Power of Art Hackathon

March 11-13

Join us for our first hackathon where participants are challenged to use technology 
to design innovations that enhance the art-viewing experience.  
For an entire weekend we will give hackers access to art, curators, and digital collections as t
hey develop new ways to engage with art. 
Contestants will be judged on innovation, feasibility, and engagement, and the winning team will take home $1,000.

Interested? Register <http://philadelphiamuseumofart.cmail20.com/t/r-i-vkukjil-l-h/> now. 
You can register as a team or an individual.

If you canâ€™t make it the whole weekend, please join us on 
Sunday, March 13 at 2:00 p.m.<http://philadelphiamuseumofart.cmail20.com/t/r-i-vkukjil-l-u/> 
when the five finalists will present their projects to judges and a 
public audience in our Van Pelt Auditorium. 
The audience will get a sneak peek of the best innovations and 
will be able to vote for the People's Choice Award recipient.
